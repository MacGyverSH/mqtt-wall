Downalod MQTT wall package (**[stable version](https://github.com/bastlirna/mqtt-wall/releases)** or [latest build](http://jslab.net/pub/mqtt-wall/))\r\n2. In index.html file there is configuration, put there your broker connection (MQTT over websockets is required).\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nThis project was created as demo for my talk about MQTT on conference [Linux Days 2015](https://www.linuxdays.cz/2015/en/). First version took me about one hour. Since then codebase was completely rewritten.\r\n",
