## Usage

1. Downalod MQTT wall package (**[stable version](https://github.com/bastlirna/mqtt-wall/releases)** or [latest build](http://jslab.net/pub/mqtt-wall/))

## History

This project was created as demo for my talk about MQTT on conference [Linux Days 2015](https://www.linuxdays.cz/2015/en/). First version took me about one hour. Since then codebase was completely rewritten.
