## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bastlirna/mqtt-wall.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bastlirna/mqtt-wall) [![Build list](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-list-lightgray.png)](http://jslab.net/pub/mqtt-wall/) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/c7957e9f6394477cb5d1b13fc66b5561)](https://www.codacy.com/app/horcicaa/mqtt-wall?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=bastlirna/mqtt-wall&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Main Goal

- Clean and simple design
- Nice on big screen with huge font (overhead projector during lecture)
- Just subscription of single topic (including wild cards of course)

## Demo

You can try **[demo](http://bastlirna.github.io/mqtt-wall/demo/)** using Mosquitto test server (*test.mosquitto.org*).

## Usage

1. Download MQTT wall package (**[stable version](https://github.com/bastlirna/mqtt-wall/releases)** or [latest build](http://jslab.net/pub/mqtt-wall/))
2. In index.html file there is configuration, put there your broker connection (MQTT over websockets is required).

## History

This project was created as demo for my talk about MQTT on conference [Linux Days 2015](https://www.linuxdays.cz/2015/en/). First version took me about one hour. Since then code base was completely rewritten.

## Develop

You will need git, node.js, npm and grunt.

1) Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/bastlirna/mqtt-wall.git
cd mqtt-wall
```

2) Install dev. dependencies

```
npm install
```

3) Build source code and run dev. http server (http://localhost:3000/)

```
grunt serve
```

Alternatively you can run `grunt build` to build source code (new directory `dist` will show up) or run `grunt watch` that will stay running and build src. whenever source code changed. `grunt server` does both and additionally serve result via [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/).

If you need dev. MQTT broker, go to

```
cd tools/test-broker
npm install
node test-broker.js
```
