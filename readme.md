## Main Goal

- Clean and simple design
- Nice on big screen with huge font (overhead projector during lecture)
- Just subscription of single topic (including wildcards ofcourse)

## Disclaimer

This project was created as demo for my talk about MQTT on conference [Linux Days 2015](https://www.linuxdays.cz/2015/en/). It took me about one hour and from then I barely touch the code. It's useful little tool but not production ready.
